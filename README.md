    cd class-booking-system
    ```

2. **Setup Environment**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file and update:

    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name

    MAIL_PASSWORD=null
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@example.com"
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

4. **Docker & Laravel Sail**
   Make sure **Docker Desktop** is installed.

    Add this to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

    ```bash
    alias sail='sh $([ -f sail ] && echo sail || echo vendor/bin/sail)'
    ```

    Then restart your terminal or run:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Start the application:

    ```bash
    sail up -d
    ```

5. **Run Migrations & Seed Database**

    ```bash
    sail artisan migrate --seed
    ```

    > This will create tables and populate them using your defined seeders.

6. **Run Vite (Frontend Dev Server)**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7. **Run Laravel Queue Worker**

    To process queued jobs like email notifications:

    ```bash
    sail artisan queue:work
    ```

8. **Access the Web App**
   Open your browser to:
    ```
    http://localhost
    ```

## 🧪 Default Test Accounts

The database seeder creates default users for each role. You can use these credentials to log in and test the dashboards:

| Role          | Email               | Password |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| 👤 User       | abdullah@mail.com   | password |
| 👤 User       | omar@mail.com       | password |
| 👨‍🏫 Instructor | instructor@mail.com | password |
| 🛠️ Admin      | admin@mail.com      | password |

> All seeded users have the default password: `password`

Once logged in, you’ll be redirected to the dashboard that matches your role (User, Instructor, or Admin).

🎉 That’s it! Your Laravel class booking system is now up and running.
